# Linear Regression Analysis of Oceanographic Parameters

## Overview
In fulfillment of an AI course task, I conducted a linear regression analysis to explore the correlation between various oceanographic parameters. The goal was to unveil potential correlations and gain valuable insights.

## Oceanographic Database - CalCOFI Stations
This database contains oceanographic data obtained from seawater samples collected at CalCOFI stations. The dataset includes a variety of oceanographic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, and more. The Bottle Database covers the entire timeseries, spanning from the initiation of CalCOFI in 1949 to the present day. The database is provided in four different formats and can be downloaded using the links below.
